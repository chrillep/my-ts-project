A batteries included template for kick starting a TypeScript Cloudflare worker project.

## Note: You must use [wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/cli-wrangler/install-update) 1.17 or newer to use this template.

## 🔋 Getting Started

This template is meant to be used with [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler). If you are not already
familiar with the tool, we recommend that you install the tool and configure it to work with
your [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com). Documentation can be
found [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/).

To generate using Wrangler, run this command:

```bash
wrangler generate my-ts-project https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-typescript-template
```

### 👩 💻 Developing

[`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts) calls the request handler in [`src/handler.ts`](./src/handler.ts), and will return
the [request method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/method) for the given request.

### 🧪 Testing

This template comes with jest tests which simply test that the request handler can handle each request
method. `npm test` will run your tests.

### ✏️ Formatting

This template uses [`prettier`](https://prettier.io/) to format the project. To invoke, run `npm run format`.

### 👀 Previewing and Publishing

For information on how to preview and publish your worker, please see
the [Wrangler docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/commands/#publish).

## 🤢 Issues

If you run into issues with this specific project, please feel free to file an
issue [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-typescript-template/issues). If the problem is with Wrangler, please
file an issue [here](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/issues).

## ⚠️ Caveats

The `service-worker-mock` used by the tests is not a perfect representation of the Cloudflare Workers runtime. It is a
general approximation. We recommend that you test end to end with `wrangler dev` in addition to
a [staging environment](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments/) to test
things before deploying.
